## What

This was a project that ran for June of 2023.
If you'd like to run the site yourself, take a look at app.rs and uncomment the new function component.

## Who

The button was created by Melody Henrich, a game development student at Northeastern University.

## Why

I created the button as a side project in an effort to study mass collaboration and FFA politics.
Ultimately, I believe the experiment was successful.
The site achieved a record no-press time of over 1 day, and a total of over 6,000 clicks.
I am closing the site to avoid paying for the servers required to host it.
If you would like pressit.baby to get back up and running, feel free to support me on ko-fi.

Thank you all.
